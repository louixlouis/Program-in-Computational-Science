"""
Problem 1.

When two strings, "message" and "text", are provided, 
determine how many times "message" occurs as a substring of "text". 
It's important to note that occurrences of "message" may overlap in "text"
For instance, the message "aa" occurs 3 times in the text "aaaabb".

The following conditions must be satified.
    1. If the length of "message" is longer than the length of "text", 
       the occurences of "message" will be -1.
    2. If either "message" or "text" has a length of 0, the occurrences will also be -1.
